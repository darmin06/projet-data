🔍 LLMRec Replication – Augmenting Recommender Systems with LLMs
This repository contains the academic replication of LLMRec, a method combining graph-based recommender systems with Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve performance on sparse datasets.

🧠 Goal: Demonstrate the methodological steps of LLMRec, even without full-scale computational resources or paid APIs.

📚 Project Overview
Original paper: LLMRec: Large Language Models with Graph Augmentation for Recommendation (Wei et al., 2024)
Focus: Enrich a user–item graph using simulated LLM outputs (e.g. GPT-3.5) to improve recommendations
Scope: Methodological replication using simplified data and simulated augmentations
Dataset: MovieLens 100k (small-scale for reproducibility)
🗃️ Script Reference
This section documents all the main scripts used in the project, including their purpose, inputs, outputs, and execution order.

📌 scripts/preprocess.py
Purpose:
Loads the raw MovieLens 100k dataset and filters ratings ≥ 4.0 to generate implicit feedback.

Inputs:

data/movielens_100k/ratings.csv
Outputs:

Filtered DataFrame (used internally or saved manually if needed)
Run order:
Run first to understand or preview the data structure before augmentation.

📌 scripts/simulate_llm_augmentations.py
Purpose:
Simulates GPT-generated augmentations such as user profiles, new interactions, and item attributes.

Inputs:

data/synthetic/fake_profiles.json
data/synthetic/fake_interactions.csv
Outputs:

Augmented records used to expand the user–item graph (e.g., in notebooks)
Run order:
Run after preprocessing and before encoding.

📌 scripts/encode_features.py
Purpose:
Encodes textual item descriptions or attributes using basic feature extraction (e.g. TF-IDF).

Inputs:

Simulated item descriptions (hardcoded or loaded)
Optionally: generated attributes from LLM simulation
Outputs:

A matrix of item embeddings (for potential graph input)
Run order:
Run after augmentation (if encoded item profiles are needed).

📌 scripts/evaluate.py
Purpose:
Simulates evaluation metrics (Recall@5, NDCG@5) for baseline vs augmented recommendations.

Inputs:

None (outputs are hardcoded or symbolic)
Outputs:

Printed results to console
Run order:
Can be run after graph augmentation or from 03_simulated_results.ipynb for visualization.

📓 Jupyter Notebooks
In addition to the core scripts, the following notebooks are provided to explore and demonstrate the workflow:

🧪 01_visualize_dataset.ipynb
Purpose:
Explores the MovieLens dataset with plots and statistics.

Inputs:

ratings.csv, movies.csv
Outputs:

Visuals of rating distributions and most rated movies
Order:
Can be run at the beginning to understand the dataset.

🧪 02_augmented_graph_demo.ipynb
Purpose:
Builds and visualizes a user–item graph from synthetic interactions.

Inputs:

fake_interactions.csv, fake_profiles.json
Outputs:

Graph object, visualization of the node-link structure
Order:
Run after augmentation simulation (simulate_llm_augmentations.py)

🧪 03_simulated_results.ipynb
Purpose:
Loads pre-filled metrics and generates bar plots comparing baseline and augmented recommendation performance.

Inputs:

metrics_baseline.csv, metrics_augmented.csv
Outputs:

Performance comparison chart (Recall@5, NDCG@5)
Order:
Final step in the workflow; can be run to illustrate improvement.

### ✅ 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/llmrec-replication.git
cd llmrec-replication

##2- If using a virtual environnement
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

pip install -r requirements.txt


##3- To lauch the scripts
python3 scripts/preprocess.py
python3 scripts/simulate_llm_augmentations.py
python3 scripts/encode_features.py
python3 scripts/evaluate.py

##4- Launch Jupyter Notebook to execute the notebooks
#in bash
jupyter notebook
#If Jupyter asks for a token, copy it from the terminal (look for token=... in the URL).


#Then open notebooks on Jupyter and  the following notebooks :

01_visualize_dataset.ipynb

02_augmented_graph_demo.ipynb

03_simulated_results.ipynb
